NAME
    File::Flock::Retry - Yet another flock module

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.59 of File::Flock::Retry (from Perl
    distribution File-Flock-Retry), released on 2014-12-05.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Flock::Retry;

     # try to acquire exclusive lock. if fail to acquire lock within 60s, die.
     my $lock = File::Flock::Retry->lock($file);

     # explicitly unlock
     $lock->release;

     # automatically unlock if object is DESTROY-ed.
     undef $lock;

DESCRIPTION
    This is yet another flock module. It is a more lightweight alternative
    to File::Flock with some other differences:

    *   OO interface only

    *   Autoretry (by default for 60s) when trying to acquire lock

        I prefer this approach to blocking/waiting indefinitely or failing
        immediately.

METHODS
  $lock = File::Flock::Retry->lock($path, \%opts)
    Attempt to acquire an exclusive lock on $path. $path will be created if
    not already exists. If $path is already locked by another process, will
    retry every second for a number of seconds (by default 60). Will die if
    failed to acquire lock after all retries.

    Will automatically unlock if $lock goes out of scope. Upon unlock, will
    remove $path if it was created and is still empty (this behavior is the
    same as "File::Flock").

    Available options:

    *   retries => int (default: 60)

        Number of retries (equals number of seconds, since retry is done
        every second).

  $lock->unlock
    Unlock.

  $lock->release
    Synonym for "unlock()".

CAVEATS
    Not yet tested on Windows. Some filesystems do not support inode?
